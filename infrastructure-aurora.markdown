title: Using Apache Aurora
layout: main
categories: infrastructure
---

It's now possible to use [Apache Aurora](https://aurora.apache.org) to
schedule long running jobs, cron jobs, and ad hoc job on the ALICE Mesos
infrastructure.

ALICE Aurora instance can be found at:

https://aliaurora.cern.ch

It is used for a number of jobs an in particular for the continuous builders
of the pull request.

Access is allowed to ALICE members who are part of the
`alice-aurora-users` egroup. You can subscribe to it by going to
the usual [egroups page](https://e-groups.cern.ch/e-groups/Egroup.do?egroupId=10225666).

## Getting the client
{:get-the-client}

The GUI is only a read-only view on the state of the jobs
running on the cluster. If you want to interact with Aurora
itself you will need the aurora client.

You can get a binary distribution of the Aurora client at:

<https://github.com/alisw/aurora/releases/tag/0.16.0-alice2>

Alternatively you can download the sources and build it with:

```bash
./pants binary src/main/python/apache/aurora/kerberos:kaurora
cp dist/kaurora aurora
```

If you use homebrew, you can also do:

```bash
brew install ktf/system-deps/alice-aurora
```

## Configuring your environment
{:configuring}

Access is allowed to ALICE members who are part of the
`alice-aurora-users` egroup. You can subscribe to it by going to
the usual [egroup page](https://e-groups.cern.ch/e-groups/Egroup.do?egroupId=10225666).

The authentication mechanism uses kerberos, so you should make sure
you have a valid kerberos ticket in the CERN.CH realm. You can verify that 
by doing:

```bash
$ klist
```

which should result in something like:

```
Credentials cache: API:5BD2DB44-B9A8-48BD-9CD1-47078B7D00A9
        Principal: <your-cern-user-name>@CERN.CH

  Issued                Expires               Principal
Aug 13 14:26:57 2019  Aug 14 00:26:57 2019  krbtgt/CERN.CH@CERN.CH
```

In order to reach the Aurora cluster, you need to configure how to
access it. This is done by creating a file `~/.aurora/clusters.json`:

    [{
      "name": "build",
      "scheduler_uri": "https://aliaurora.cern.ch",
      "auth_mechanism": "KERBEROS",
      "slave_run_directory": "latest",
      "slave_root": "/build/mesos"
    }]

If everything is setup as expected you should be able to get a list of
jobs by doing:

```
$ aurora job list build
```

If you are an admin, you should also verify that `aurora_admin` also works.

```bash
$ aurora_admin get_cluster_config build
{"auth_mechanism": "KERBEROS", "name": "build", "scheduler_uri": "https://aliaurora.cern.ch"}%
```

## Run a simple application
{: simple-app}

We keep Aurora configuration files in:

<https://gitlab.cern.ch/ALICEDevOps/ali-marathon>

in the `aurora` folder. You can for example look at the "Hello world"
example:

    ali-marathon/aurora/hello.aurora

You can start it with:

    $ aurora job create build/mesostest/devel/hello hello.aurora
      INFO] Creating job hello
      INFO] Checking status of build/mesostest/devel/hello
     Job create succeeded: job url=https://aliaurora.cern.ch/scheduler/mesostest/devel/hello

This will start on the cluster a (somewhat) long running job. You can open the provided web page to look at the workarea.
If you want to interact with the job in an ad-hoc manner, e.g. to debug what it is doing or force some action to it, you can SSH to the machine running the job by doing:

    $ aurora task ssh build/mesostest/devel/hello/0
    
which will ssh for you in the sandbox for the job on the machine it is running. Notice that you might still have to `docker exec` yourself into the container to get the correct environment. Alternatively you can execute a one off job by doing:

    $ aurora task run build/mesostest/devel/hello/0 "hostname > foo.txt"
    
You can find more information about the available commands in the [official Aurora documentation]( http://aurora.apache.org/documentation/0.16.0/reference/client-commands/).

## Gotchas & issues
{: gotchas}

* On Costin machines, for security reasons the log provider are not running, so you need to directly ssh inside them and look at the filesystem.

* On some systems, the CERN CA is not available by default. You can overcome this by either:
  * Go to <https://ca.cern.ch> and install all the required CA certificates. In general this is what is needed on macOS.
  * Obtain it via `scp lxplus.cern.ch:/etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt ca-bundle.crt` and doing `export REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE=$PWD/ca-bundle.crt`.
  * Installing the `CERN-CA-certs` package and doing `export REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE=$PWD/ca-bundle.crt`.

* On some systems, kerberos gives a token for the actual backend name, rather than aliaurora. You can check that by doing klist and you will see `HTTP/alibuild-frontend01.cern.ch@CERN.CH`:

```bash
Credentials cache: API:B7FC3DD4-738F-417E-B2FA-92B2CCA9590C
        Principal: eulisse@CERN.CH

  Issued                Expires               Principal
Aug 14 15:50:42 2019  Aug 15 01:50:42 2019  krbtgt/CERN.CH@CERN.CH
Aug 14 15:50:46 2019  Aug 15 01:50:42 2019  HTTP/alibuild-frontend01.cern.ch@CERN.CH
```

In order to fix this you will have to change your kerberos configuration, usually found in `/etc/krb5.conf`, and add `rdns = false` in the `[libdefaults]` stanza. 

* On mac the most reliable way to operate is:
  * First do `kdestroy`
  * Then do `kinit`
  * Finally `aurora job list`
  * The three steps above should guarantee that Firefox has the correct token.
  
* SSH / running ad-hoc tasks on some of the machines requires extra work, most notably on Costin's `alientest` machines which do not use kerberos. In order to be able to login, you need to ask the admin of such machines to add your SSH key to 
the `.authorised_keys` of the user which has the same name as the role for the job (e.g. `mesostest` for `build/mesostest/devel/hello`).
